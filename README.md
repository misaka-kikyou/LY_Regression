The scripts MLR.py development was performed using python script and MatlabÂ® with a linear regression algorithm. The in-house script normalized each molecular feature in order to allow the coefficients of the features describe the relative importance of each feature. 
The script get-Coordinates.py was used to extract the final coordinates of the intermediates or transition states from the output file (*.log) of gaussian 16 and output as a full Coordinates.xyz file.
